Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer.
Build a comprehensive "Hostel & PG Management SaaS Dashboard" for PG owners.
The app should look modern, clean, and professional.

### 1. TECH STACK & STYLE
- Framework: React (Next.js App Router) or Vite.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Icons: Lucide React.
- State Management: React Context or Zustand.
- Theme: Use CSS variables for colors so I can easily change the "Primary Brand Color" in one place.
    - Default Primary Color: #4F46E5 (Indigo).
    - Background: Light gray/white for cleanliness.
    - Text: Dark slate for readability.

### 2. CORE LAYOUT
- **Sidebar Navigation (Left):**
  - Dashboard (Home)
  - Room Management (Manage beds/rooms)
  - Tenants (List of active tenants)
  - Payments & Rent (Collection status)
  - Expenses (Track daily spending)
  - Reports (Profit/Loss)
  - Settings (Profile & API Config)
- **Top Bar:** Search bar, Notification Bell, User Profile Dropdown.

### 3. DASHBOARD VIEW (HOME)
The main dashboard must show high-level KPIs:
- **Top Cards:**
  1. "Total Tenants" (Active count).
  2. "Occupancy Rate" (Percentage of beds full).
  3. "Pending Rent" (Total money yet to collect this month - highlighted in Red).
  4. "Total Revenue" (Collected this month - highlighted in Green).
- **Recent Activity Feed:** List of recent payments received or new tenants joined.
- **Occupancy Chart:** A simple visual bar showing filled vs. empty beds.

### 4. KEY FEATURES & LOGIC

#### A. Room Management
- View rooms as "Cards".
- Each card shows: Room Number, AC/Non-AC, Total Beds, Available Beds.
- Visual Indicator: Green dot for "Available", Red dot for "Full".
- Action: Click a room to see which tenants are inside.

#### B. Tenant Management
- Table view of all tenants: Name, Phone, Room No, Rent Due Date, Status (Paid/Unpaid).
- **Add Tenant Form:** Fields for Name, Mobile, Aadhar Number (ID Proof), Joining Date, Security Deposit.
- **WhatsApp Action:** A button next to each tenant to "Send Message" (opens WhatsApp Web with a pre-filled template).

#### C. Rent & Payments
- Logic: Rent becomes "Due" on the 1st of every month.
- **Payment Status:** Toggle button for "Paid" vs "Unpaid".
- **WhatsApp Reminder:** If status is "Unpaid", show a "Send Reminder" button that triggers a WhatsApp API message template.

#### D. Expense Tracker (Important)
- A separate tab to log daily hostel expenses.
- **Categories:** Electricity, Water, Cleaning, Maintenance, Staff Salary, Groceries.
- **Logic:**
  - Input: Amount, Date, Category, Description.
  - Output: Calculate "Total Monthly Expenses" and subtract from "Total Revenue" to show "Net Profit".

### 5. THEME & COLOR CUSTOMIZATION
- Create a `globals.css` file where the primary color is defined as a variable (e.g., `--primary-color`).
- All buttons, active links, and charts must use this variable.
- Explain in the code comments exactly where to change the hex code to swap the entire app's color theme (e.g., from Indigo to Orange).

### 6. DELIVERABLE
Provide the complete folder structure and the code for the main components (Sidebar, Dashboard Layout, Tenant Table, Expense Form) ensuring they are responsive (mobile-friendly).
